When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to share my work with others or when i am working on a shared project, I will use remote repository rather than keeping
all my work local.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When working on a collaborating project, we may want to clarify the changes done on the last commit before pulling it to the local 
repository, so pulling manually may be a better way.
