How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?

While viewing two versions of a file, we can check only that part of the code or file where there was difference,
so we did not have to go through the whole code to check for some simple subtle mistake.




How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
 efficient programmer in the long term?

If i have the access to the entire history of the file, i can make changes without getting worried about losing the part of the file which is correct, so it can help
me work efficiently.



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?



Pros for manually choosing when to create commit is that we get to decide what work we want to finalise at any time, 
and con for that is if we fail to commit the changes by any chance, all the work we have done for that part can be lost
Pro for having versions automatically saved is that we don't have to worry about loosing our work,
con for that is sometimes some non useful work or code can get updatedin the version which can create confusion for us.



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    
Git version control system is for mainly coding purpose, In most of the cases, for any application, for single tasks 
more than one files are getting affected, that is why these version control system allow saving multiple files in one commit.



How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    
We can use git log command to get the list of commits made to the file, and git diff command gives the details
of what changes were made for a particular commit.



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    
Using version control will remove the fear of losing existing functionality of the app while making any changes
in the code hence improving confidence.



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?


I would like to use git for trying out some small code
