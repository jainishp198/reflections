What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we initialize a repository, git creates a history file ".git" to track history of any file in the repository.
We need to do it to maintain the history of our file in a new repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermediate stage of repository and working directory. It contains the files that we want to commit.
The staging area let us decide what files we want to update in the next commit to the repository

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
We can use git diff --staged to check if we have modified only one logic since the latest commit or not using staging 
area

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When we want to try out some new logic or different way of a logic, branches would be helpful in keeping the original code
safe.
