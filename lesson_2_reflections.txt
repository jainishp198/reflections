What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we initialize a repository, git creates a history file ".git" to track history of any file in the repository.
We need to do it to maintain the history of our file in a new repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermediate stage of repository and working directory. It contains the files that we want to commit.
The staging area let us decide what files we want to update in the next commit to the repository
